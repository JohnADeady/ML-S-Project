    "The aim of this project is to analyse the Boston House Prices dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, included in this analysis, we must demostrate the use of Python, packages scipy, keras and jupyter. \n",

    "The Boston Housing Dataset consists of price of houses in various places in Boston. Alongside with price, the dataset also provide information such as Crime (CRIM), areas of non-retail business in the town (INDUS), the age of people who own the house (AGE), and there are many other attributes [1].This is a small dataset consisting of 506 cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report seeks to examine the influence of several neighborhood attributes on the prices of housing, in an attempt to discover the most suitable explanatory variables. The specific neighborhood attributes to be considered are proximity to the Charles River, distance to the main employment centers, pupil-teacher ratio in schools, and levels of crime. Whereas the original study focused on air pollution using nitrogen oxide concentrations as an explanatory variable, this report examines whether or not there are other, better explanatory variables for the median value of houses in Boston. The R programming language will be used to conduct this analysis.[7]"
